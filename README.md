Basic Idea of Git:

Git works on 3-tier architecture principle where we have different stages like Local Files, Staging Area and a Repository. This 3-tier architecture is the most advantage of the Git and we won’t find this type of architecture in any version controls.
	Local files is the place where we initialize the Git and keep all the files. In Staging Area we can keep all the files changed. From Staging area we push the files to Repository. From Repository we can push the code wherever we want. Staging area is very important. In this we can find the difference of the files (what is there/ added/ removed…). We can keep track of every file. Internally every files goes to Repository from local files through Staging Area only.
